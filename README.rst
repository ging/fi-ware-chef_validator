External Dependencies
---------------------

The system deployment depends on several external services for successful completion.
The dependency list reads as follows:

- OpenStack Keystone server:
    Used for issuing user tokens for several OpenStack services

- OpenStack Glance server:
    Used for listing the available virtual machine images

- OpenStack Nova server:
    Used for deploying the selected virtual machine

- Chef server:
    Used to coordinate chef activities

Validation Process
------------------

The cookbook validation process consists on the following steps:

1. The **Client** sends a POST request to the service API, containing:
    - The name of the cookbook to be tested
    - The *Github* repository from which to obtain the cookbook
    - The virtual machine name for deployment
2. The **Server** recieves the request and takes the following steps:
    - Checks the user permissions to take the next steps by validating against Keystone
    - Downloads the needed *cookbook*
    - Deploys the selected *Virtual Machine* image
    - Instructs the **Chef Server** to deploy the *cookbook* in the given *Virtual Machine*
    - Responds to the **Client** request informing of the status of the validation process
